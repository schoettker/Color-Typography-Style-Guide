Showcases the use of Sass to create a style guide for colors and typography.
Modifying a variable for example in the $primary-colors list changes the whole Style Guide accordingly. This is achieved using Sass to compile corrseponding CSS.
However, CSS should not be used to modify content and this was just for practicing purposes.

I did this as part of an excercise from [Epicodus] (http://www.epicodus.com/), where this was adopted from and inspired by [https://codepen.io/blindingstars/](https://codepen.io/blindingstars/).
